- The goal for today was to successfully install Django for the project. I am having some trouble with the installation. I have successfully created the virtual environment but for some reason, I am unable to connect Django. This virtual environment attempt was made after trying to install Django globally on the machine but had the same issue. Python, pip, and Django are all installed on the machine.
